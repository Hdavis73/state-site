            Houston, an urban city located in Southeast Texas, is best known for its food scene, and its connection to space travel, which presents itself in the famous saying "Houston, we have a problem". In the 1960s Houston was chosen to be the
            home of the federal government's Manned Spacecraft Center, and since that day many of Houston's biggest establishments have been space themed in name, such as the famous "Astrodome", the baseball team "The Astros", and even Houstons
            nickname; Space City. While Houston's history with space travel is a great reason to visit, the food scene in this city is also out of this world. For decades Houston has been a #1 destination for immigrants from all over the world
            (Houston immigrant population, 2021), and in turn, you'll find the most diverse restaurant selection in Texas right here in the heart of the city.

            <img src="Imgs/space-center-houston.png" alt="space center Houston" />
            <p>
              The Houston Space Center is an interactive, immersive museum for all things space. It spans 250,000 sqft of exhibits and over 400 Space artifacts (Space Center Houston, 2023). Visiting this attraction also allows you to learn about the
              city's roots in space travel, so you can spend the rest of your time in Houston in the know about one of the city's biggest accomplishments.

            <h6>Buffalo Bayou Park</h6>
            <img src="Imgs/bayou-park.png" alt="Buffalo Bayou Park" />
            <p>
              Buffalo Bayou Park is a large stretch of land with space for concerts, picnics, and plenty of play sites for the kids, but the biggest thing this site is known for is being the site where the Allen Brothers founded the city in the 1800s
              (The Buffalo Bayou Park Project, 2023),
              <a href="https://www.houston.org/timeline#:~:text=Houston%20in%20the%201830s&text=Houston%20founded%20on%20August%2030,near%20headwaters%20of%20Buffalo%20Bayou." target="_blank">click here</a>

            <h6>The Astrodome</h6>
            <img src="Imgs/astrodome.png" alt="Astrodome" />
            <p>
              The Astrodome is yet another thing Houston is well known for, as this was the first indoor, air-conditioned baseball stadium in the world. Being built only 6 years after the city's space exploration center launched, the space-age
              appearance and name of this venue makes perfect sense (Encyclopedia Britannica). This is home to Houston's baseball team, "The Astros", aptly renamed to boast their home field after the Astrodome was built.
