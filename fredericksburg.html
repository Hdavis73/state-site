            This little suburban city is located in central Texas, roughly an hour and a half outside of the state capital. Fredericksburg Texas is small and mighty, with a population of 11,257 and an immense amount of interesting history behind it.
            Fredericksburg was founded by German immigrant Baron Otfried Hans von Meusebach (History Fredericksburg, TX), and holds pride in its German roots, housing all of its history and teaching about German heritage in the famous Pioneer Meuseum
            (Pioneer Home Page). If you're looking for a smaller town to travel to with lots of rich history to learn about, put Fredericksburg at the top of your list.
