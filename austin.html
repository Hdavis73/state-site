            Located in central Texas, the city of Austin may be the capital of Texas, but you'll find much more than just country hoedowns in this city. Austin is well known for being the "Live Music Capital of the World", with plenty of popular live
            music venues to choose from. During the day, Austin is all about hustle and bustle, with people from all walks of life traveling to and fro to work or shop, but at night, especially on Fridays and Saturdays, 6th Street is where it's at. A
            walk down 6th street on a weekend night will present you with guitarists up and down the way, food vendors, food trucks, and the roar of live music in all the many popular nightclubs. This kind of nightlife is not for the weak, as you
            will be surrounded by hundreds of other people walking the sidewalks and standing in lines.
